# CyberDrop List Generator

**A Cyberdrop.me list generator,**

Cyberdrop has recently had some fucky wuckies when it comes to downloading media from them,

this tiny python script generates a .txt file containing cyberdrop links that removes the old fs-0 direct link style in favour for cyberdrop.me, one that works.

  

## ***Requirements:***

To install the requirements of this script, install the requirements.txt file and do `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal to install them onto your system
  

## **How to use:**

1. Obtain a cyberdrop.me link that you wish to download the files from.

2. Launch the script from terminal using py ./CDListGen.py while working in the directory.

3. Paste the link into the terminal when 'URL:' pops up and press enter.

4. View the links.txt file created in the scripts directory, you will have your links.

5. Use a tool like JDownloader 2 (https://jdownloader.org/) to add the list of links to linkGrabber.

6. Click Start all Downloads in JDownloader 2 and your download will begin.

  

**Enjoy.**
